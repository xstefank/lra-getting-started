Sample demo application with setup steps to get started with MicroProfile LRA specification

You can choose to follow the steps described in this document or you can directly move the
final solution in the link:end-solution[End solution directory] and follow the startup steps
there.

== LRA getting started guide

=== Prerequisities

For our examples we will use Throntail as the runtime. Go to https://thorntail.io/generator/
and create an application called lra-service with JAX-RS and CDI fractions:

image::thorntail-generator.png[Thorntail project generator example]

Extract your downloaded ZIP into a work directory (let's call it `WORK_DIR`):

`unzip /path/to/lra-service.zip -d $WORK_DIR`

`cd $WORK_DIR`

and open the project in your favourite IDE. Also please change the
`<build><finalName>` in your generated `pom.xml` from `demo` to
`${project.artifactId}` which allows us to differenciate our services.

=== Part 1 - starting first LRA

To start with LRA we need to include two maven dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.lra</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile-lra-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-RC1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.narayana.rts</groupId>
  <artifactId>narayana-lra</artifactId>
  <version>5.9.8.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

The first dependency is a MicroProfile LRA API binary containing all of the
required classes that users interact with. The second one is the dependency
on the https://narayana.io[Narayana] implementation of the MP LRA specification.

NOTE: In fact, only the narayana-lra dependency is required as it also
transitively pulls MP LRA dependency. But in the environments where the
implementation of the specification can be provided by the container, only
the MP LRA dependency can be used as users interact only with the LRA
specification API.

Add these two dependencies to the LRA service `pom.xml`.

LRA specification is based on the JAX-RS. For a start, let's create a new
JAX-RS resource called LraResource:

[source,java]
----
package io.xstefank.example.lra.lraservice.rest;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation.ws.rs.LRA;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.HeaderParam;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import java.net.URI;

@Path("/lra")
@ApplicationScoped
public class LraResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/perform")
    @LRA
    public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
        System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);

        return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
    }
}
----

As you can see, this is a normal JAX-RS resource enhanced with the `@LRA` annotation.
The `@LRA` annotation is the main entry point for the LRA specification. The
default behavior starts a new LRA when this method is invoked and finishes it
when the method end.

We also added a specification defined LRA header parameter
(`LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER == "Long-Running-Action"`) in which the
implementation passes the LRA identification which is represented by a
unique URI. This LRA id can be used later for the work associated with this
particular LRA.

The Narayana implementation is based on the orchestration approach which means
that Narayana provides an LRA coordinator microservice that is responsible for
the LRA processing and execution. The LRA coorodinator is a required service
for the LRA to funtion properly. It is provided as a Docker image so to
start the LRA coordinator you can run:

`docker run --rm --name lra-coordinator --network host jbosstm/lra-coordinator`

or alternatively you can download the Narayana LRA source code from
https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/tree/master/rts/lra[GitHub] and build it
and run it locally. The coordinator jar is localted in the lra-coordinator
directory.

Now that the LRA coordinator is running we can start our LRA service:

build the service with: `mvn clean package`

and run it with: `java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8081 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-thorntail.jar`

NOTE: We need to start the LRA service on the port 8081 as the LRA coordinator
already occupies the port 8080. We also have to specify where the coordinator
runs by `lra.http.port` property (the default host value is localhost).

Now we can start our first LRA by invoking this endpoint:

`http :8081/lra/perform`

NOTE: I am using https://httpie.org[HTTPie] but if you are more used to curl, perform a GET call
like this `curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/lra/perform`.

Congratulations, we have started and finished our first LRA. For now, it's
not doing anything else so let's enlist our `LraResource` as a participant
in the newly started LRA.

=== Part 2 - Enlisting an LRA participant

To enlist `LraResource` as an LRA participant we need to include a PUT JAX-RS
method annotated by the `@Compensate` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@PUT
@Path("/compensate")
@Compensate
public Response compensate(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
    System.out.println("COMPENSATING LRA " + lraId);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

This method represents the compesnation action that is going to be invoked
when the LRA (which the resource joined and also started in our case) is
cancelled. This happens when the `@LRA` method execution fails with a
specific JAX-RS response code which by default is in the families of 4xx and
5xx codes. Let's change our `@LRA` method to return 412 Precondition Failed
status code to cancel the LRA rather than close it:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/perform")
@LRA
public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
    System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.status(Response.Status.PRECONDITION_FAILED).build();
}
----

Notice that we also added a new header paramater called
`LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER`. This header represents a unique URI that
is received as the idendification of this participant inclusion in the
particular LRA. You can look at it as a subscription id. Performing operations
with this recoveryId can help resource identify which particular LRA is being
compensated/closed when it is joining several LRAs in parallel but also helps,
as name suggests, with the recovery if the service needs to be restarted. The
recoveryId can also be retrieved in the `@Compensate` method:

[source,java]
----
@PUT
@Path("/compensate")
@Compensate
public Response compensate(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("COMPENSATING LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("COMPENSATE recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

Now we are ready to enlist our `LraResource` in the LRA. Restart the LRA service:

kill the previous process: `Ctrl+C`

build it again: `mvn clean package`

and run it: `java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8081 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-thorntail.jar`

Execute the LRA again with: `http :8081/lra/perform`. You will see that the
LRA was now cancelled because of the returned JAX-RS return code and the
`@Compensate` method was called.

Congratulations, you've successfully started a new LRA, elisted a resource
with it, and then cancelled it which triggered the compensating action of
the enlisted resource.

=== Part 3 - Closing the LRA successfully

In some cases, you might need to perform some form of clean up actions even
in the case the LRA is successfully finished (for instance, you must
remember the Order ID for the possible compensation). For this reason, the LRA
specification also provides a callback for successfull completition called
`@Complete`:

[source,java]
----
@PUT
@Path("/complete")
@Complete
public Response complete(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("COMPLETING LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("COMPLETE recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

As you can see, the signature is almost identical to the Compensate callback.

Let's now change the LRA operation to close the LRA successfully again:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/perform")
@LRA
public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
    System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
}
----

Now you can again repeat reloading steps but when you execute the LRA you
will see that `@Complete` method is called instead of `@Compensate`.

=== Part 4 - Propagating LRA to a different microservice

So now we are in a system with a single microservice (LRA service) which
is starting LRA, elisting with it, and then closing it. Since the MicroProfile
is directed to be used in the microservices architecture, how can we
propagate LRA to a different microservice?

Let's create a new microservice by copying the one that we already have:

`cp -a lra-service lra-service-2`

Open a new terminal window and cd into the lra-service-2 directory. Open it
in your favourite IDE. First rename the `artifactId` of the service in the
`pom.xml` to `lra-service-2` to differenciate this service.
Let's now rename our `LraResource` to `ParticipantResource`
to avoid confusion in naming moving on.

Now we are all set to propagate the LRA to the `lra-service-2`. We just
need to call it from `lra-service`.

Let's move back to the `lra-service` and `LraResource`. Modify the `performLRA` method:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/perform")
@LRA
public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
    System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);
    
    // call lra-service-2
    ClientBuilder.newClient().target("http://localhost:8082/lra/perform")
        .request().get();

    return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
}
----

And that is all that's need to be done. The implementation of LRA will
automatically detect outgoing JAX-RS call and add LRA id as a header parameter
`"Long-Running-Action"` to the request. If you add this header yourself it
will be used instead. But if the LRA is not detected the LRA will include
the current active LRA it knows of which is sufficient for our example.

Now we can start our services:

In the first terminal run: `mvn clean package && java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8081 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-thorntail.jar`

And in the second one run: `mvn clean package && java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8082 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-2-thorntail.jar`

Now we have three services running:

* LRA coordinator on port 8080
* LRA service on port 8081
* LRA service 2 on port 8082

So let's excerise our microservices system by invoking the LRA service which
start the new LRA and propagates it to the LRA service 2:

`http :8081/lra/perform`

Now you will see that the `lra-service-2` also enlisted `ParticipantResource`
in the received LRA and Complete methods have been called on both services as
the LRA outcome closed successfully.

NOTE: now we are closing the LRA started in `lra-service` in the
`lra-service-2`.

Let's modify for the completness the `lra-service-2` to fail with 412 to
cancel instead of close:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/lra")
public class ParticipantResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/perform")
    @LRA
    public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                               @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
        System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
        System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);

        return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
    }
----

And recompile and restart `lra-service-2` again (in the second terminal):

`mvn clean package && java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8082 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-2-thorntail.jar`

And now when you execute the scenario again (`http :8081/lra/perform`) you
will see that Compensate methods have been called on both services.

If you plan to continue with the advanced part of this tutorial please return
`lra-service-2` back to returning 200:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/lra")
public class ParticipantResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/perform")
    @LRA
    public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                               @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
        System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
        System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);

        return Response.status(Response.Status.PRECONDITION_FAILED).build();
    }
----

Congratulations! We have covered all of the basic usage of the LRA and now
you are ready to start using it in your services. Next sections will dive
a little more into the detailed usage and tuning of the LRA.

=== [Advanced] Part 5 - Eventual compensation/completitions

So far we've covered three LRA states:

* `LRAStatus.Active` - an active LRA
* `LRAStatus.Closed` - successfully closed LRA
* `LRAStatus.Cancelled` - a successfully compensated LRA

However, there are also a few more:

* `LRAStatus.FailedToClose` - LRA couldn't be fully closed
* `LRAStatus.FailedToCancel` - LRA couldn't be fully cancelled

These two states represent exceptional conditions in which one or more of
the participants cannot perform their ending operations (Complete or
Compensate). This state must be logged by the implementation and probably
a manual interaction is required to resolve potentional conflicts. Also
an implementor may choose to utilize some form of heuristics in these cases.

The last two LRA statuses are:

* `LRAStatus.Closing` - LRA is currently closing (calling Complete callbacks)
* `LRAStatus.Cancelling` - LRA is currently cancelling (calling Compensate
callbacks)

These two states represent intermediate states between LRA being asked to end
and its actual end.

For long running Completitions or Compensations that would require a long
periods of time to finish, the specification allows to return these
progressive states from Complete or Compensate callbacks. This can be done
in several ways but for our use-case it's enought to return just 202 Accepted
status code from the Complete or Compensate method. This will allow the
implementation to know that it needs to replay ending phase for this particular
participant again after some predefined timeout.

Let's modify `lra-service`:

[source,java]
----
private boolean accepted = true;

@PUT
@Path("/complete")
@Complete
public Response complete(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("COMPLETING LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("COMPLETE recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return accepted ? Response.accepted().build() : Response.ok().build();
}

@GET
@Path("clearAccepted")
public void clearAccepted() {
    accepted = false;
}
----

As you can see, if the end phase method return Closing or Cancelling (202)
response this end phase method will be eventually called again so it must be
idempotent.

Now you can recompile and restart services and replay the scenario again:

`http :8081/lra/perform`

but notice that if you wait for some time (by default it's 2 minutes) the
Complete call at `lra-service` will be called again. If you don't want to
wait, you can trigger the recovery on LRA coordinator by a call:

`http :8080/lra-recovery-coordinator/recovery`

Now we need to actually finish our Complete operation (so it returns 200
instead). To do that invoke clearAccepted endpoint:

`http :8081/lra/clearAccepted`

and wait or replay recovery again:

`http :8080/lra-recovery-coordinator/recovery`

The call will now return an empty JSON array which means that the LRA is finished.
You can also verify that the LRA is ended by a call to `http :8080/lra-coordinator`.

==== Status method

As we saw previously, when the end phase call cannot be completed immediately
the Complete or Compensate method will be called repeatedly so it must be
idempotent. If you can't make it idempotent, the specification allows you
to specify a new method annotated with the `@Status` annotation that will be
called when the implementation processes recovery instead.

Let's add a `@Status` method to `lra-service`:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/status")
@Status
public Response status(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                       @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("STATUS FOR LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("STATUS recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return accepted ? Response.accepted().build() : Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Completed.name()).build();
}
----

NOTE: `@Status` method must be in JAX-RS case a GET JAX-RS endpoint.

And recompile and restart the scenario again.

Now you notice that first time when the LRA is asked to complete, the Complete
method is called at `lra-service`. However, on the recovery (triggered by
timeout or manually) you can notice that Status method is called instead.

NOTE: Notice that we need to return `ParticipantStatus` from the Status method.

==== Forget method

Since the participant may need to remember some information in case the
potential compensation is needed (e.g. the order id to know which order
needs to be cancelled) the MP LRA specification provides an annotation
called `@Forget` that the participant may use to denote a method that
will be called when the LRA cannot be finished successfully (
`FailedToClose` or `FailedToCancel` states) to clean up no longer relevant
information.

Let's add the `@Forget` method to `lra-service`:

[source,java]
----
@DELETE
@Path("/forget")
@Forget
public Response forget(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                       @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("FORGET FOR LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("FORGET recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

NOTE: `@Forget` method must be in JAX-RS case a DELETE JAX-RS endpoint.

And change the Status method to actually fail the close of the LRA by returning
`ParticipantStatus.FailedToComplete`:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/status")
@Status
public Response status(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                       @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("STATUS FOR LRA " + lraId);
    System.out.println("STATUS recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return accepted ? Response.accepted().build() : Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.FailedToComplete.name()).build();
}
----

You can notice now that when the LRA is finished (after accepted status
is cleared) the Forget method is also called.

=== [Advanced] Part 6 - Inspecting LRA annotation in detail

Now is the right time to investigate the `@LRA` annotation in more detail. The
most important attribute of this annotation is `value` parameter which is
setting the transactional type of the LRA executed in the annotatated method.
The possible values are:

* `REQUIRED` - default (and what we used up to this point). Starts a new LRA
only if there is no LRA context (represented by `LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER`
header) received in the invoking call.

* `REQUIRES_NEW` - always starts a new LRA even if there is one received.

* `MANDATORY` - must be called with LRA context otherwise it returns 412
Precondition Failed status code.

* `SUPPORTS` - may be called with LRA context but doesn't have to.

* `NOT_SUPPORTED` - method will be executed without LRA context (LRA will
be resumed after the method ends).

* `NEVER` - if executed with the LRA context it returns 412 Precondition
Failed.

* `NESTED` - starts a new LRA which will be nested under the received
context or a new LRA if no context is received.

For the example purposes we don't need to invastigate individual LRA types
in more detail but feel free to consult the specification text and JavaDoc
for more details.

Another important attribute is called `end` which is a boolean value
indicating whether the LRA should be ended (closed/cancelled) when the method
is finished. The default value is `true`. Let's experiment a little with
this attribute. 

Update the `lra-service` `@LRA` method to this:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/perform")
@LRA(end = false)
public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
    System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);
    
    // call lra-service-2
    ClientBuilder.newClient().target("http://localhost:8082/lra/perform")
        .request().get();

    return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
}
----

WARNING: Also remove Status and Forget methods and accepted responses
if you followed the previous part.

And `lra-service-2` `@LRA` method like this if needed:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/perform")
@LRA(end = false)
public Response performLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId,
                           @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER) URI recoveryId) {
    System.out.println("PERFORMING LRA work " + lraId);
    System.out.println("PERFORM recovery id: " + recoveryId);

    return Response.ok(lraId.toString()).build();
}
----

NOTE: Note, that we are now returning status 200 OK because cancellation has a 
priority over `end = false`.

And add another method to the `lra-service` that will close the LRA:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/end")
@LRA(value = LRA.Type.MANDATORY)
public Response endLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
    System.out.println("ENDING LRA " + lraId);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

Now you can restart both services and replay the example scenario:

`mvn clean package && java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8081 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-thorntail.jar`

`mvn clean package && java -jar -Dthorntail.http.port=8082 -Dlra.http.port=8080 -jar target/lra-service-2-thorntail.jar`

And call the `lra-service` to start a new LRA but do not close it:

`http :8081/lra/perform`

You may notice that PERFORM calls have been executed but the Complete calls
have not yet been delivered. You can also query the LRA coordinator directly
to request all active LRAs that it knows of:

`http :8080/lra-coordinator`

This will return a JSON object with only one LRA which is still active. To close
the LRA we've started we need to call a method which has a value of `end = true`
(remember that it is a MANDATORY endpoint so we must pass the LRA we want
to close in `LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER` header):

`http :8081/lra/end Long-Running-Action:http://localhost:8080/lra-coordinator/0_ffffc0a80066_3cb52bba_5da089cb_45`

NOTE: Copy the LRA Id URI from the log of any of the services or from the
first call to the `lra-service`.

Now the LRA is closed and the Complete calls are received at both services.

The next attributes to mention deal with the conditions on which the LRA
should be cancelled:

* `cancelOn` - HTTP response codes on which to cancel
* `cancelOnFamily` -  families of response codes on which to cancel (default 
are 4xx and 5xx)

These attributes, as the name says, specify the cancellation conditions. We
already used them for our compensation examples so we don't need to excercise
them again.

The last attributes of `@LRA` annotation are `timeLimit` and `timeUnit`
which allow you to specify the timeout of the LRA after which it will
became eligible for cancellation. Again, example would be pretty
straitforward so we will not include it here.

=== [Advanced] Part 7 - AfterLRA notifications

Any LRA microservice (not necessarily a participant) can optionally enlist
for a notification which is received when the LRA is finished. This can be done
by annotating any method of the class that contains a different `@LRA`
annotated method with the `@AfterLRA` annotation.

Let's add an `@AfterLRA` method to `lra-service`:

[source,java]
----
@PUT
@Path("/after")
@AfterLRA
public Response after(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_ENDED_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI endedLRA) {
    System.out.println("AFTER_LRA ended LRA: " + endedLRA);

    return Response.ok().build();
}
----

And replay any of the previous scenarios which finishes the started LRA. You
will see that this method is invoked. This functionality may be used to, for
instance, start a new LRA once another one ended or for the evidence of all
LRAs that are being passed in the system.

=== The End

This would be all for this tutorial the finished solution which followed these
steps can be found in the link:end-solution[End solution directory]. Hopefully,
you learned how to use MicroProfile LRA specification and you can start now
using it in your microservices applications.

=== Troubleshooting

You can always query the all LRAs that the LRA coordinator knows of by a call:

`http :8080/lra-coordinator`

which return JSON array of LRAs. If you get stuck just try to restart the 
individual services and LRA coordinator. Otherwise, please raise
https://github.com/xstefank/lra-tutorial/issues[an issue].
